## dde-istate-menus

IStat menus on macOS alternative for DDE.

> This software has nothing to do with the Istat menu excepting adopting its UI design

> The main part of the system monitoring code in `utils` comes from [deepin-system-monitor](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/deepin-system-monitor)

> Still in development

### Known issues

* dock widgets' text are really small even the widget has enough space, or text is too large and only part is shown on the widget. I think it is related to the dde-dock [issue](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/dde-dock/issues/271)
